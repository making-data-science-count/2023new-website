<h2><strong>Project Introduction</a></strong></h2>
The Computer Science for Appalachia (CSA) project is a NSF funded project (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1923509">award number: 1923509</a>). It addresses the challenge of providing meaningful computer science (CS) learning experiences in East Tennessee school districts, particularly in the context of new CS standards for the state. Implemented in 2019, CSA aims to create a vision for CS education, offering support for teachers to plan and implement responsive CS strategies in rural East Tennessee schools. This National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded initiative, led by co-principal investigators Dr. Joshua Rosenberg and Dr. Amir Sadovnik, involves collaboration between the University of Tennessee, three rural school districts, and key community organizations to enhance CS education and opportunities for elementary-grade students in Appalachia.
