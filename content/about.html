  The mission of the MDSC research group is to leverage the collective efforts of its members to study science education, computer and data science education, and educational technologyâ€“and other domains. This group will be dynamic and inclusive in its work (due to the expertise members bring and valuing of that expertise). The group studies both K-12 and post-secondary and informal learning and uses a variety of theoretical and methodological approaches to do so.
