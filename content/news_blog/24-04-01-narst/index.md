Attending conferences is a big part of academic life. It's a place to catch up old friends, meet up new faces, and of course, to be inspired by all these new brilliant ideas in the field. Three people within our group - Maryrose, Amanda, and Hanhui - attended NARST this year in Denver, CO. NARST is a cool conference for science education people, where you can always have fun and refind the passion for research at the same time. 

Our group had 2 presentations this year. Maryrose presented about undergraduate studentsâ€™ anxiety in biology classes using Intensive Longitudinal Methods. Amanda and Hanhui presented about how data literacy was integrated in an open resource curriculum. Both teams did an awesome job in presenting and well represented UT at NARST. We are proud of them and look forward to highlights from all of us at future conferences.
