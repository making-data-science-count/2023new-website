Two doctoral students from our lab, Wei and Hanhui, attended the conference. They seperately presented their great work, with topics on [AI](https://convention2.allacademic.com/one/aera/aera24/index.php?cmd=Online+Program+View+Paper&selected_paper_id=2168327&PHPSESSID=vl0oc2vk94slikkcpdgc53qsoj) and [autonomy](https://convention2.allacademic.com/one/aera/aera24/index.php?cmd=Online+Program+View+Paper&selected_paper_id=2112215&PHPSESSID=vl0oc2vk94slikkcpdgc53qsoj). They successfully networked with peers and faculty members in the field. As two first year doc students, it is a great accomplishment to present at such a prestigious conference. They absolutely did a great job on promoting their work and names out there, and representing UT and our MDSC lab exceedinglly. We are very proud of them and can not wait to see their future success, and we look forward to seeing all our lab members shine at their fields!
