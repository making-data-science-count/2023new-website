American Educational Research Association (AERA) annual meeting is a the worldâ€™s largest gathering for the education community. Education people connect and reconnect with colleagues and friends, find collaborators, and get inspiration. The 2024 annual meeting took place in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, April 11-14, with over 2,500 presentations.

Two doctoral students from our group, Wei Wang and Hanhui Bao, attended the conference. They seperately presented their great work, with topics on [AI](https://convention2.allacademic.com/one/aera/aera24/index.php?cmd=Online+Program+View+Paper&selected_paper_id=2168327&PHPSESSID=vl0oc2vk94slikkcpdgc53qsoj) and [autonomy](https://convention2.allacademic.com/one/aera/aera24/index.php?cmd=Online+Program+View+Paper&selected_paper_id=2112215&PHPSESSID=vl0oc2vk94slikkcpdgc53qsoj). They networked with peers and faculty members in the field. As two first year doc students, it is impressive that they both presented at AERA. We are very proud of both of them and look forward to future presentations at and beyond AERA. Hope to see you next year in Denver!
