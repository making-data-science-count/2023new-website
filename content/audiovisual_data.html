<h2><strong>Project Introduction</a></strong></h2>
This project, Theory-based Computational Analysis of Classroom Audiovisual Data, or T(CA)^2 as we like to refer to it, is a three-year National Science Foundation-funded project focused on advancing methodologies that combine grounded theory based approaches with computational analyses of classroom video data. The interdisciplinary team is based at three institutions: the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Middle Tennessee University, and the University of Tennessee at Knoxville.
