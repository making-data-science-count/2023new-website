<h3><strong><a href="/self_reflection_in_csed">Self-reflection in CS Education</a></strong></h3>
This project aims to understand how students develop their process of working on computer science projects, and testing a new approach to help CS students. This project is a collaboration between UTK and Pellissippi State Community College (PSCC), and is funded by the National Science Foundation. 
<br />

<h3><strong><a href="/project_credible">Project CREDIBLE</a></strong></h3>
This is a NSF CAREER project. It advances middle and high school students' data modeling in ecological contexts by taking a Bayesian approach that is supported and studied as an informal statistical inference framework.

<h3><strong><a href="/esm-undergrad-stemed">ESM and Undergraduate STEM education</a></strong></h3>
This project is using an intensive longitudinal survey method - experience sampling - to explore how levels of anxiety change over time in introductory biology classes and how anxiety may impact final grade.
<br />

<h3><strong><a href="/sensitivity-analysis">Sensitivity Analysis</a></strong></h3>
This paper presents an introductory and overview for the konfound() R package which is a sentiatively analysis package to quantify the robustness of causal inferences. This paper provides an overview of two core functions within the package: konfound() and pkonfound().

<h3><strong><a href="/cs-for-appalachia">CS for Appalachia</a></strong></h3>
The NSF-funded project, Computer Science for Appalachia (CSA), led by Dr. Joshua Rosenberg and Dr. Amir Sadovnik, aims to address this by creating a CS vision and supporting teachers in planning and implementing responsive strategies.
<br />

<h3><strong><a href="/audiovisual_data">Theory-based Analysis of Audiovisual Data</a></strong></h3>
This project is a three-year National Science Foundation-funded project focused on advancing methodologies that combine grounded theory based approaches with computational analyses of classroom video data. The interdisciplinary team is based at three institutions: the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Middle Tennessee University, and the University of Tennessee at Knoxville.
