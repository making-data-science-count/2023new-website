      <description>Part of our reserach group had a lovely lunch and took some photos on 11/21. We looked back this semester and looked forward to the near future, talking about the highlights/stress/challenges. Everyone is in different stages and has different goals, but the good news is that we can always find someone to look for advice and support. All conversations are relaxing but thought-provoking, just like the vibe of our lab.</description>
